Retina Blood Vessel Segmentation Using CNN: A Step Towards Improved Ophthalmic Diagnostics
Introduction
Retinal blood vessel segmentation is a critical task in the field of ophthalmology, aiding in the diagnosis and monitoring of various eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration. Traditional methods for segmenting retinal vessels are often labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. To address these challenges, I developed a Retina Blood Vessel Segmentation model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This model automates the segmentation process, providing accurate and efficient analysis, which can significantly enhance diagnostic workflows.
